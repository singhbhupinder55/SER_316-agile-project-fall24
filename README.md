# SER 316 - Agile Software Project (Fall 2024)

This repository contains my coursework for **SER 316: Software Enterprise – Design & Process**, focused on **Agile Software Development** at **Arizona State University**.

## 🧾 Course Overview

The course emphasized hands-on experience with:
- Agile workflows (Scrum, sprints, task boards)
- Clean code practices
- Unit testing and static analysis
- Incremental software development and peer reviews

## 📁 Project Structure

This repository consists of multiple branches representing tasks and workflows:

| Branch         | Purpose                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Dev`          | Main development branch                                 |
| `Blackbox`     | JUnit-based black-box testing                           |
| `Whitebox`     | White-box testing based on control flow and paths       |
| `Review`       | Code review and defect logging                          |
| `StaticAnalysis` | Static code analysis with Checkstyle and SpotBugs     |
| `metrics1`     | First pass at software metrics analysis                 |
| `metrics2`     | Updated metrics after refactoring and fixes             |

## ✅ Core Activities Completed

- ✅ **Task 1**: Black-box unit test planning and implementation  
- ✅ **Task 2**: Refactor code for testability and fix style violations  
- ✅ **Task 3**: White-box testing with control flow path analysis  
- ✅ **Task 4**: Static analysis using Checkstyle and SpotBugs  
- ✅ **Task 5**: Peer code review with markdown defect logs  
- ✅ **Task 6**: Code metrics analysis (LOC, CC, methods)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Java 18  
- JUnit Jupiter  
- Gradle  
- Checkstyle  
- SpotBugs  
- GitHub Actions (CI)

## 📈 Sample Metrics & Reports

- ✔️ **SpotBugs**: No high-confidence bugs in the final iteration  
- ✔️ **Checkstyle**: All style violations resolved  
- ✔️ **JUnit**: 100% test pass rate on final branch  
- ✔️ **Metrics**: Analyzed LOC, cyclomatic complexity, and test coverage

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Agile workflows and iterative development  
- Code testing from both black-box and white-box perspectives  
- Static analysis and automated code quality tools  
- Effective team collaboration using Git and pull requests  
- Writing clean, testable, and maintainable Java code
